* This is a new release.
* We understand that the installed size of 8.1MB may be of concern. Please note that this size is due to the inclusion of reference distribution data, which is necessary for the proper functionality of the package. Despite the larger installed size, the package itself is within CRAN's size limits of less than 5MB. We have carefully considered the resolution of the reference values and have determined that reducing their size further could impact the functionality of the package. We hope this information is helpful and we appreciate your consideration of our package.
