* This is a new release.
* Some functions have default settings that rely on large data sets that are downloaded after installation. As a result, many examples in the documentation are wrapped in \donttest clauses. In these cases, an alternate version of the example that does not require external data is also provided, and is wrapped in \dontshow clauses.
